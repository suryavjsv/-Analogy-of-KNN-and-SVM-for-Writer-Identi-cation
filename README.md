# -Analogy-of-KNN-and-SVM-for-Writer-Identi-cation
The work presents an eﬀective method for writer identiﬁcation in handwritten documents. We have developed a local approach based on the extraction of characteristics that are speciﬁc to a writer. To exploit the existence of redundant patterns within a handwriting, the written text is divided into large number of small sub-images and the sub-images that are morphologically similar are grouped together into same class. 
The process involves preprocessing, feature extraction, classifying them using KNN and SVM classiﬁer and comparing them.
